Welcome to my Nix-ified infrastructure and personal monorepo.

## Contents

This repository contains my Nix-related experiments.
Beyond managing dotfiles, I have also experimented with [packaging some of my commonly used applications](#packages) and [managing a homelab worth of services](#homelab).

Common operations are defined in the root [`Makefile`](./Makefile).
To list Makefile targets run `make help`.

`make directory` can help if you're lost:

### Packages

This flake contains several packages that I rely on day to day:

- [`oscal-cli`](./packages/oscal-cli/)
- [`oscal-deep-diff`](./packages/oscal-deep-diff/)
- [`xspec`](./packages/xspec/)

These packages are **UNOFFICIAL**, experimental, potentially transient, and come with no guarantees or warranty.
If you would like to see these packages submitted [upstream](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) or to the [NUR](https://nur.nix-community.org/), **please open an issue on this repository as a signal of interest**.

### Homelab

_Network diagram [generated](./.github/workflows/artifacts.yaml) with [`oddlama/nix-topology`](https://github.com/oddlama/nix-topology)._

The [`homelab` module](./modules/homelab/) packages most of my homelab-specific configuration, including media management and monitoring.

For usage examples, refer to the [`hades`](./hosts/hades/) host configuration:
